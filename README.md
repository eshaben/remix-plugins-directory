 # Conditions for adding a new plugin

 - The plugin should work on both light and dark theme types. The best would be to check them before approving any change or any new plugin.
 - No `svg` file is acceptable as a plugin icon for security reasons. We recommend using `webp` or png formats.
 - Profile `json` should contain as much info as possible. Having a short, reasonable description as well as the link to docs and the repo will improve the onboarding of users
 - Maintained by Remix should be added to plugins 100% controlled by the Remix team only.
